It's #Day3 of #21DaysToData challenge. Todayâ€™s task given by Avery Smith was to tag three of my connections where they can share their experiences working in three different data roles. This task is kind of a challenge to me and a few others that I would tag here.
 
 
Today we learned about different data roles and the task is to find out the job responsibilities. I like to be a Data Scientist or Data Analyst in my future career. So, I am trying to write something about these roles. If my view is incorrect, please feel free to provide insights. 
Data Scientist: Kawsar, is a Data Scientist at IDARE. His task is to predict the data after performing descriptive and diagnostic analysis. He has designed an Intelligent Dengue Prediction System and Disease Management where he predicted the number of Dengue cases in different cities after analyzing the historical weather data. He also worked with the data from disaster surveys, relief support systems, and data on flood-affected people. I hope I guessed it right. If not, please feel free to make me correct it.
Data Analyst: Shelby Hogue, Data Analyst at Acxiom. I guess, her task in her job is to analyze data using statistical techniques, provide reports and develop and implement databases and data collection systems. If I am wrong please feel free to make me correct.
 
Data Engineer:  Srividya Krishnan, Data Engineering at Tyson Foods. I guess her task is to build systems that collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information for data scientists and business analysts to interpret. Their goal is to make data accessible so that organizations can use it to evaluate and optimize their performance. I hope I guessed it right. If not, please feel free to make me correct it.
